Amphetamin plugin by TheFloW - the very first in-game plugin

This is a simple plugin that set ARM clock to 444mhz. By pressing SELECT for a few seconds, the amphetamin plugin menu will show up where you can set ARM/BUS/GPU frequency.
I have only done a benchmark with 444mhz ARM clock, BUS is already at its max, and whether GPU frequency increasement does change anything is not known.

Put the plugins folder at ux0:plugins. The plugin will only work with games that have been dumped with Vitamin.
